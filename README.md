# battleship-2

This project is a recreation of the popular kids game Battleship.
The creation of this project took almost a month because half of that time was almost impossible to keep up working with the development.

It's not really finished.
There's room for improvement.
Like beautifing the webpage looks or adding more functionalities.


Know Bugs/Issues:
- In the Placement Menu:
  * The boats can overflow from the board, if they're set on the edges
  * If you set a boat that's already on the board; the boat that was set before would continue to exist occupying space.

- In the Game screen:
  * The game doesn't really have a way to tell when the game is over(although, there should a function somewhere that check if all the boats on a gameboard
    are sunked, that keeps checking everytime a hit on any board is done).
  * The pc player don't have a way to set their boats randomly in the gameboard.

Improvements ToDo:
- There also should be a way to select difficulties in the starting screen.
- The player should have a marker that tells them where the ship is going to be set
- The boats set by the player should be shown in the player's board in the game screen
- Add a gameOver screen.
- Add 16-bit music
- Add effect sounds for when the player hits a boat
- Add more animations.
- ...
